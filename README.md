# ADS1220RTD_Brewno_V2_1_PIC_Code

This is the code for the PIC controller on the shield.
To program the chip you will need a PIC kit or a Curiosity Board. I personally went with the Curiosity Board.

The files shared here were created using Microchips MPLAB X v3.45. A copy of this IDE is available free. The MCC add-on to MPLABX was also used and is also available free.

I tried to include the main project files as individual files here, but I've never tried to copy and paste a project in MPLAB.  Just in case, I've also included a .zip file of my entire MPLAB project folder so you can copy and paste into a project directory if needed.
